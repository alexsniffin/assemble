The query was for a comprehensive list of all iPhone models along with their respective release years. From the Wikipedia data obtained, I observed that there are multiple generations of iPhones released over the years, starting from the first generation in 2007 up to the latest models. Each generation has various models within it, such as the iPhone SE, iPhone XR, and iPhone 12 series. The information includes details like model names, release dates, and significant features for each model. This data can be used to create a comprehensive list of all iPhone models and their release years.Review your thoughts, actions and observations and don't repeat yourself from previous notes.\\n\\nHere are the tools you have access to, you DO NOT have access to other tools, use the name of the tool you think can help:\\n\\\"\\\"\\\"\\nname: wikipedia\\ndescription: A wrapper around Wikipedia.
